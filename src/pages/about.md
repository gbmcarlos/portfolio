##### What started as a hobby

At the early age of 11 years, I found out about web development. More specifically, HTML. It immediately struck a chord with me. Without any other guidance than just my curiosity and an internet connection, it slowly expanded into front-end development, with the help of JavaScript and CSS.

Some time later, I cautiously approached back-end development, with PHP and MySQL. And finally, at the age of 18, I got the chance to experience the real world of software development when I got a part time job as a junior developer. 

##### An adventure in Asia

After a year working in Barcelona, I received an opportunity to travel to Southeast Asia for another Web development job.

In the Philippines and Hong Kong I learnt the intricacies of working in a team of dozens of developers and in an international company, expanding to new countries almost monthly.

##### Steady and serious

In the next adventure, I moved to Dubai, where I exercised as a second-in-command designing and architecting a distributed system. I also started spanning more stacks, and disciplines, as well as taking on more responsibilities and getting more in contact with the business side of the development lifecycle.

In a lateral move, I took another position in the same city, where I stayed for over 3 years. There, I advanced my technical and soft skills and obtained the role of Technical Lead.
